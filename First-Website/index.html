             <p>
                To get an overview of the WWW or World wide web we first need to 
                understand the concept and definition of it.
                The Web is also known as the worldwide computer network,
                this gives users access to a wide variety of documents and resources 
                such as open blogs. 
                These resources are all interlinked by a common means of a hypertext
                or hypermedia links. This is referred to as a word that contains
                an embedded link that takes you to the desired document (Gregersen, 2019).

             <p>The world wide web is vital for day-to-day functionality. When looking into a civilised persons day we see that at some point in their life they have at least once used the World Wide Web for numerous reasons. The ability of the World Wide Web is set into motion when looking at its ease of use and its various multimedia ability for transmitting media such as text, graphics, audio, and video and to retrieve detailed information, worldwide in a matter of seconds (Sluyters, 1997). </p>

             <header>Components of the WWW</header>
             <p>The success of the WWW lays within the powerful system of interlinked controls, that allows users to fully explore sets of data stored in different computers on the internet. This wide system is called the hypertext that allows any sort of data to be accessed from a web page by seeing an underlined or highlighted text. When clicking on this link, users are then routed to the desired document or location. This web of pages gives the WWW its origins. Every Web page has its own title, that is also known as the URL (Uniform resource locator). The result of this is a wide variety of Webpages. Browsers is software that access and displays pages and files that is on the web (UITS, n.d.). This allows users to retrieve and display the pages on the computers, users use what is called search engines to navigate around on the webpages (Sluyters, 1997). </p>

            <header>The basic operation of the WWW</header> 
            <p>The web works on a basic principle of storing and transferring web pages from a server to a local user’s computer upon request. Web servers is software that serves web pages. The computer of a user that requests for a document is also referred to as a client. Browsers then allow user to retrieve those documents, (JavaTpoint, n.d.). 
                From here all the websites can be stored in a web server. A basic server hosts a website upon request. Further components that help with the transferring pf information from servers to clients that includes (HTML) – Hyper text markup language (HTTP)- Hypertext transfer protocol and browsers.

              <p>"Your time is limited so don't waste it living someone else's life.
                 Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other
                 poeple's thinking. Dont let the noise of others' opinions drown out Your
                 inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart And
                 intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become.
                 Everything else is secondary." </p>
