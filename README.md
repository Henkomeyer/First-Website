# First-Website
This is my first functional website that we created in varsity, we were tasked to create a website that shows the history of the internet.

We worked in a group of three and HTML and CSS was a brand new language that we learned in the week of creating this website. 

Some of the images wont load because of directories being changed. 

You can take a look at the website on this link :
